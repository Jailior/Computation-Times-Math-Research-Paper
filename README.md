Time efficiency and scalability of programs for larger and larger data sets have become ever so important with the advancement of technology. Machine learning algorithms are based on processing huge data sets and repeatedly carrying out operations. When using math functions such as sine, cosine and logarithms the conventional way to do so in code is to use the long and complicated, as to achieve high accuracy answers, external libraries which have been coded by other computer scientists long ago. I propose simplifying these functions can save time for the same result.

**Aim**: To see how the simplification the mathematical functions using both the Taylor and McLaurin series to lower run times of computational programs.

**Conclusion**:
Returning to my aim at the beginning of the investigation, to simplify the mathematical functions using both the Taylor and McLaurin series to lower run times of computational programs in which the functions are used. I believe I was able to achieve this aim and gain interesting insight in the way different functions are built and how this effects the time saved when simplified. The three functions provided insight in how more complicated functions will benefit from the simplification using McLaurin and Taylor series.
